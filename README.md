# a11y-conf-guide
Template for an accessibility guide to conferences

This document can be used as a checklist to 
+ create a conference guide that covers all accessibility features of a conference
+ research the accessibility of a conference venue
+ prepare a list of accessibility requirements when scouting for conference venues

It is not very fancy, but that is what github is for - you fork a copy and make your own. I do hope the base document can really contain a lot of rich detail. 

This guide is dedicated to the memory of Fabien Vais, who conceived the idea for such a guide back in 2002 for the Society for Technical Communication conference in Nashville, Tennessee, USA.
